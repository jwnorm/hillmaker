Release Notes
=============

This is the list of changes to hillmaker between each release. For full details,
see the commit logs at http://github.com/misken/hillmaker

What is it
----------

**hillmaker** is a Python package that computes time of day and day of week specific
occupancy statistics from transaction data containing arrival and departure
timestamps. Typical use is for capacity planning problems in places like
hospital emergency departments, surgical recovery rooms or any system in which
entities arrive, occupy capacity for some amount of time, and then depart. It
gets its name from the hill-like nature of plots based on temporal occupancy
statistics.

hillmaker 0.4.3
===============

**Release date:** 2022-07-19

**New features and API changes**

- can use TOML formatted config file for command line args
- added percentiles to CLI
- renamed verbose argument to verbosity



hillmaker 0.4.2
===============

**Release date:** 2022-07-15

**New features**

- Added option to treat missing departure timestamps as censored data.

**Bug Fixes**

- disallowed missing entry timestamps

hillmaker 0.4.1
===============

**Release date:** 2022-07-14


**Bug Fixes**

- date range sanity check had copy paste error with start and end variables
- removed old licensing references
- fixed typos in basic usage notebook
- added hillmaker related blog post links to readme

hillmaker 0.4.0
===============

**Release date:** 2022-07-14

**New features**

- added basic usage explainer notebook

**Bug Fixes**

- adjusted arrivals and departures by bin arrays to account for stops with arrivals or departures outside the analysis range


hillmaker 0.3.0
===============

**Release date:** 2022-05-13

**New features**

- the main new feature is speed
- added CLI
- added flow conservation checks
- added logging

**Improvements to existing features**

- Greatly improved speed by moving many computations into numpy arrays and vectorizing things.

**API Changes**

- deprecated use of multiple category fields and reverted to previous functionallity of a single (optional)
category field. Multiple categories are best handled with composite keys.

**Bug Fixes**

hillmaker 0.2.3
===============

**Release date:** 2020-03-18

**Bug Fixes**

- replaced call to deprecated time.clock() with time.process_time()

hillmaker 0.2.0
===============

**Release date:** 2020-02-04

**New features**

* Added `edge_bins` parameter to control how occupancy contribution is computed
for arrival and departure bins. 1=fractional contribution (default), 2=whole bin

* Multiple category fields allowed.(GH0017_)

.. _GH0017: https://github.com/misken/hillmaker/issues/17

    totals: int, default 1
        0=no totals, 1=totals by datetime, 2=totals bydatetime as well as totals for each field in the
        catfields (only relevant for > 1 category field)
        
* Can specify a field to use as occupancy weights. This can be useful
for building plots of workload instead of occupancy.

**Improvements to existing features**

**API Changes**

**Bug Fixes**

* Replace deprecated sortlevel() by sort_index() (GH0020_)

.. _GH0017: https://github.com/misken/hillmaker/issues/20



hillmaker 0.1.1
===============

**Release date:** 2016-01-24

**New features**

**Improvements to existing features**

**API Changes**

**Bug Fixes**

  * Removed duplicate output of category, bin of day and day of week fields (GH0018_)

.. _GH0018: https://github.com/misken/hillmaker/issues/18




hillmaker 0.1.0
===============

**Release date:** 2016-01-22

**New features**

:mod:`hillmaker` consists of the following things and features

 * Takes a pandas DataFrame as the input data type
 * Functions for computing arrival, departure and occupancy summary statistics
   by time bin of day and day of week based on a pandas DataFrame containing one
   record per visit.
 * Functions for computing arrival, departure and occupancy for each datetime
   bin in the analysis period.
 * Select any time bin size (minutes) that divides evenly into a day.
 * Optionally specify one or more categories to ignore in the analysis.
 * Output statistics includes sample size, mean, min, max, standard deviation,
   coefficient of variation, standard error, skew, kurtosis, and a whole slew
   of percentiles (50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97.5, 99).
 * Output CSV files are written by default but can be supressed.
 * Optionally capture outputs as a dictionary of pandas DataFrames for further
   post-processing (e.g. plot creation).
